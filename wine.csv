999,Chardonnay 2018,4.2 Excellent wine. I don’t like it quite as much as the 2017 vintage but still excellent. Green apple and lemon are the main fruits I get alongside a yeast note that caries a white pepper/ green peppercorn spice and lemon pith bitter finish. Lovely acidity. I suspect the bottles I cellared will age well. ,4.5
1000,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,"A very muscular CCR that I brought to a dinner party last night. 100% Sangiovese that was very fruit forward.
Opened with a core of plum and raspberry with notes of licorice and spice mid palate. Finishes with a whiff of tobacco.

Very dry wine and great with pizza. ",4.0

Some dark fruit, blackberries, boysenberries, some tobacco and hints of herbs. Quite complex, but still what annoys me is how the oak dominated.

Palate is similar: concentration, complexity, mix of aromas are all there. Oak is first, fruit follows, herbs third. Quite a big body, medium acidity. This wine has some potential. Something I would like to revisit in 10 years.",3.9

1627,Mucho Más Tinto NV,"Black cherry in colour and fruitiness hits the nose, not that usual for a Spanish wine. On the palette the fruit explodes,  blackberry, cherry and vanilla wrapped up with that balanced smoke and oak with a subtle hint of licorice. It’s big, bold, fruity, smooth and I love it! Definitely a future guilty pleasure, unusual fruitiness for a Spanish wine and for the price… amazing value! ",4.5

Not a very complicated or complex wine, and I fear next time I try it it will be underwhelming, but at his price I don’t mind at all. ",4.5
1636,Mucho Más Tinto NV,"Great spanish red. Totally low profile and simple. Sophistication is in the essence.

for not too much money this is a beautiful table wine par excellence.",4.5
1639,Mucho Más Tinto NV,"This is a fascinating Spanish wine, that does not drink like an Old World bottle.  Intensely fruity nose of blackberry, blueberry, tobacco and vanilla.  Full bodied with luscious ripe fruit on the palate, and while it is a bit of a fruit bomb it’s got just enough structure and earthy notes to keep it balanced and just make it plain delicious!   14.5% alcohol, medium acid, moderate tannins, definitely a crowd pleaser.

1644,Mucho Más Tinto NV,The syrah component really adds some fruitiness and jaminess to this tempranillo. Still full bodied and dark fruited but closer to a pays d'oc red than a spanish tempranillo. Packs a punch but goes down easily. Stunningly good value for the price. Recommended,4.2
1645,Mucho Más Tinto NV,"An exceptional wine. A deep purple  colour. A complex aroma including vanilla, coffee and black friluit. On the palate there is cherry, plum, jam and some nutty notes. Pleasant tannins. Soft and round with delicate acidity. Good value for money. ",4.5

It represents a great value, and was enjoyable to drink mid-week with a variety of foods - curry chicken and the next night pasta - great with both. The nose is so typical for a New Zealand x Sauv Blanc, with lemongrass, lime and citrus, intense minerality, floral notes, and abundant smoke. The wine itself is fresh and vivid, with citrus and mineral the prime notes. Lingering finish that is tart and smoky, and yet elegant",4.5

Like Stellenbosch in South Africa, Marlborough is fast becoming another one of my favourite places for wine production.

Big hits of grass, gooseberry, lemon and apple. I even picked up a hint of melon which added some sweetness that I really enjoyed.

Having tried rather mediocre whites recently, this one really stands out.
Nose is eventually sweeter than of average NZ SB - grapefruit, mint, rhubarb, gooseberry, fresh hay and jasmine.
Palate feels a lot heavier than usual SB, lots of body. Sharply acidic at first sip, but a tiny amount of residual sugars is also there. White currant, apple, raw pineapple and honey. Slightly fizzy.

I've always found LAN to be a reliable producer and while they may not make the smoothest out of the Rioja bunch, I've always appreciated how their wines don't go down without a fight 🥊💥. To be honest I like it a little rough anyway 😳

Did you know: ""LAN"" is actually an acronym using the initials of the three provinces that make up the Rioja DOCa, being Logroño, Álava and Navarra.

2540,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,"This Supertuscan, made of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah is soft and well balanced. The color is dark ruby. Medium body and soft tannins. Actually this is its disadvantage. It lacks a bite. It's in fact too soft. It has a medium to long finish. And that surprised me.
This French Italian is very nice to drink. I can support this one. ",4.0
2541,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,"A solid classic Super Tuscan blended out of 65% CS, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah, aged in barriques for about 8 months and another 4m in the bottle. 
Warm and intense aromas of stewed berry fruit, black cherries and subtle hints of floral impressions with complementary scents of vanilla espresso, liquorice, sweet pipe tobacco and baking spice. 
A round and generous mouthfeel, showing fine grained tannins, a pleasant freshness with a medium long finish.
Not super original, but tiptop value for money!

Immediate warm, embracing & silky sensations with an optimal correspondence in the mouth. Everything floats in a world of sweet spices, black pepper and tobacco on a surface of silky tannins. Sometimes a handful of rose petals strikes me and I can't do anything but enjoying the final. A dark ruby red with a drop of garnet shades and wonderful tears on the glass complete the picture.",4.0

Some RS adds to the richness but there is enough tannin and acidity to prevent it from being flabby. This is big, bold unsubtle red, and very NW in style but I enjoy it a lot. Would be a nice pairing to baby back ribs as it should stand up to the rich glazes often used. Ultra dry reds usually come off as austere in those circumstances. Highly recommended.",4.3

Deep smooth cherry chocolate and precocious blackberry, awash in spankin oak and vanilla palatebalm - firework display of pelagic peppery sparkle and velvet cascade of sweet cherry grotto. Like riding on the back of a manta ray or like discovering the meaning of life, then forgetting and then thinking who cares anyway - in a good way.

Vanilla on the nose straight away on opening, also blackberry and blackcurrant. Smooth full mouthfeel, somewhat inky. Well made wine with that noticeable quality that comes from a hand picked harvest. More black fruit and vanilla on the palate with some mocha and caramel notes leading to a medium finish.
Did it live up to the hype? Probably, though at £25 there is a lot of competition out there. "

169,62 Anniversario Primitivo di Manduria Riserva 2017,0.0,"Another superb rich, heavy, full bodied primitive from the excellent San Marzano vineyard in Italy. Rich, super smooth and velvety. This tastes of milk chocolate, blackcurrant jam, freshly ground coffee and ripe plums. Punchy on the palate so needs pairing with something equally potent like a strong cheeseboard or red meat. I keep returning to this worthy wine and am never disappointed."

In the mouth it’s bold and balanced with smooth tannins. Taste of  vanilla,  plum and oak.

My real rate is 4.3."

177,62 Anniversario Primitivo di Manduria Riserva 2017,0.05,"An oversize bottle (almost opaque) more commonly found on big Aussie wines reveals a super-dark big wine that you’d be hard pushed to locate as italian.
14.5% alcohol, big ripe berries -plum, blackberries, jam, leather oak, chocolate, tobacco, perhaps a little tart and a finish that doesn’t fully live up to the punch that it opens with.
I’m sure we’ll be buying another bottle. Feels like it would age well."

Dark deep colour, oak, black currants, nice and fruity, but with a quality soil aroma.  Smooth, hint of plum and those dark fruits.  Decant and it opens up.  It’s a keeper.

Nose: leather, vanilla, chocolate, plum and cherry. Plus distant smoke. The smell takes me back to my relatives' home full of antique leather/wooden furniture in autumn when people burnt leaves in gardens and we were having plum crumble.
Good to enjoy on its own, but red meat or blue cheese would go with it as well."

216,7 Deadly Zins Old Vine Zinfandel 2018,0.05,"Had this Michael David Lodi Zinfandel 3 years ago but a 2012 vintage. Seems to me these old vines are producing a little more improved juice as the vines may be 6 years older now?  Flavours of blackberry, raspberry, plum, vanilla hint and a healthy shot of smoke and a bit of earthy tones. Barely dry with a fairly smooth and soft body texture. Rich dark crimson colour with modest aromas as noted. Overall enjoyable.   (3.9) "

Black fruits, earthy notes and herbs and spices, finished oaky and robust. Light sweetness, light acidity, thick tannins.

Overall quite enjoyable. 

Smooths out even more as it breathes, tannins much less harsh."
318,Anniversary 10 Th Red Blend 2019,0.1,"A bit on the sweet side, but it’s certainly a crowd-pleaser with its rich, fruity flavor.

Vanilla and oak come through on the long finish with hints of fennel, spice, and cocoa; exceedingly smooth with velvet tannins.  14.6% abv.

323,Anniversary 10 Th Red Blend 2019,0.05,"3.9. Blend of petit Syrah, Cab Sauvignon and Merlot. Ruby red in the glass with nose of black & blue fruit. This was a juice bomb, loads of jammy blackberry, plum and blueberry but not much else going on in terms of complexity. Although High in alcohol doesn’t really notice, and this paired really well with flat iron steak + Chimmichuri. "
324,Anniversary 10 Th Red Blend 2019,0.2,"I really do love the Wagner wines and was gifted this and was very excited! The color is a deep dark red. The smell is dark fruit, oak, vanilla and light hints of tobacco. The taste is velvety smooth with flavors of black cherry, blackberry, and vanilla up front. On the end you get light oak, chocolate, and tobacco and a sweetness that lingers very shortly afterwards. Overall a great wine I just slightly prefer the 1858 Red Blend over this."
325,Anniversary 10 Th Red Blend 2019,0.16,"This is a 4.25… and not quite as good as the 2018 version. An excellent “drink on its own” wine.

327,Anniversary 10 Th Red Blend 2019,0.0,"Don’t forget to decant this next time! This was an odd experience. When we first opened this it was undrinkable.

Lovely dried parchment, new leather, cherry nose, the taste is really refreshing with a really sour cherry and tar note, there’s mild vanilla  and I think the merlot kicks in a buttery mouthfeel. Certainly more full bodied and less herbaceous than Southern Italian, a lovely expressive wine, it warrants 95 points. A notably nice bottle and excellent value to boot. "

477,Astrale Rosso NV,0.08,"It's hard to believe that you can buy really good wine for such money.  Wine with the scent of blackcurrants, the taste of plums.  The wine has a red fruit finish.  Really good wine - hard to believe, but at a discount and at an incredibly low price."
478,Astrale Rosso NV,0.07,"A very good medium bodied red blend at an excellent price point. The fruit intensity is excellent with flavours of prunes, coffee, raisins, cloves, aniseed and nutmeg, finishing with a slight spiciness."

It was delicious ~ 😋🍇"
481,Astrale Rosso NV,0.0,"Make sure to let it breathe, at least 24 hours ideally 48 hours! Initially when we opened the bottle and had a glass, it wasn't what we expected, was a bit disappointed actually. But 2 days later, it's opened up and now Def worth 4.5. Paired very well with our minute steak dinner. "
482,Astrale Rosso NV,0.0,What a great surprise at this price.  Very nice depth and complexity (at least for amateur palate).  Fennel and blackberry on the nose.

The app told me
To try it so I did. I hope you’re happy. It’s neither grown up nor sophisticated in depth but it’s perfectly balanced fruits and structure make it quite playful and easy. Fresh red  raspberry compote, almost red plum and vibrant hard herbs. Dried fruit and violet back bone, with a long lingering mouthfeel and aggressive yet light tannins. 
Day 2, almost no change strangely. Thanks to vacuvin."

494,Astrale Rosso NV,0.05,"What a brilliant surprise. Can't read a thing on the label (looks to be Polish) and not sure it even has a vintage, but a beautiful heavy red with soft dark fruits and a slightly sweet finish. Assuming it must be a good primitivo and one to rival some of the better ones I've tasted. Normally I'd rate this 4, but for the price (sub £9), it deserves an extra half for value - could drink this all night long (and did give it a fair nudge)!"
495,Astrale Rosso NV,0.0,"Glad I purchased this wine. A delicious NV.
Great combo of grapes to give us plum, blackcurrant, dark cherry and lingering hint of tobacco, wood  and chocolate. Beautiful label. It would be a great BYOB in a party or dinner table. Thanks Vivino for the  recommendation. "

This wine helped remind me why I adore the Moscato varietal. Airy, and sweet, it epitomizes the grape with perfectly balanced sweetness, alcohol, and fruitness. Promptly tasting like melons with light acidity it is the perfect wine for a long phone call on a night in. Truly truly lovely."
503,Barefoot Moscato,0.0,"There’s a wine for everyone, even those who profess to not like wine. This California Moscato is one one of those, especially on a hot summer day. It sports a very low 9% alcohol level and a apple/peachy/apricot flavour with a little lemon zest. It comes from the Muscat grape which has a little higher sugar level thus this wine has a crisp sweeter taste but not overly so. It is particular good served cold on a hot summer day and usually sells for under $10. One glass won’t be enough for most folks though. "
504,Barefoot Moscato,0.0,"Can't really understand why people hate this just because it's sweet. I mean it's even mentioned on commercial description that it is a sweet wine. Seriously, read freaking description before you buy wine, and if you hate sweet wine, then just DON'T DRINK IT, okay? Jesus.

Still, this wine boasts clear coloration and a true lightness, rather than syrupy texture, that is pleasing and pleasantly surprising. The nose and taste are both laced with limestone, and while still quite sweet, there is an element of layering, and flavors of peach and hints of citrus make this an enjoyable, if not amazing, wine."

550,Bonarda 2018,0.05,A day after Thanksgiving and I was wanting something special to cheer me up!   This Malbec did NOT disappoint!!  An amazing cork and first nose of oak and raspberry!  The middle was complex with my favorite hint of chocolate 🍫 yummy...  the ending was long with light cherry overtones.  What a great wine!  The price was not bad about $21 USD. I think I will try another vintage from this winery.  What a great way to continue the holiday... Cent’ Anni 🍷!!!
551,Bonarda 2018,0.06,"Excellent stuff. Dry, the tannins are soft and well-integrated, coupled with the bright acidity allows this wine to be very easy drinking. The oak usage is super pleasant and not overpowering in the slightest. Cherry, chocolate, and smoke on the nose. A great introduction to the Bonarda grape for me."

560,Bonarda 2018,0.12,"Very tasty.  Pours a dark blackish purple color.  Lighter in body then you'd think from the color.  Smells of ripe blackberries.  The taste is amazing.  It's velvety smooth and still only medium bodied.  Taste heavily of blackberry and milk chocolate.  Cherry, vanilla, and some oak sneak in there.  Finishes with an almost balsamic syrupy spice.  The flavor lingers for ages after you taste it."

594,Bonarda 2018,0.11,"4.3. Very well made wine. Brilliant violet/purple, no rim variation, unfiltered. Stern nose of dark fruits, especially blackberries and cassis, and yogurt. Restrained and serious in the mouth with similar flavors and mild oak, medium+ acids, and medium+ finish.  Trailing flavors of cocoa nibs and hibiscus. 

Felt like this is closed down somewhat but don’t know enough about this grape to understand how it will develop. Pair with red meat and heavy pastas. Delicious.

Deep inky nose with marked new oak, that adds a softly pleasantly bitter touch to the dark purple blue berry fruit.

Full body, balanced acidity, mature bold tannins, complemented by added softly bitter oak tannins.

On the palate, the inky berry fruit enters with a full texture like creamy milk, softly bitter oak with hints of ristretto & dark chocolate, over a soft bright juicy floral cherry attack.

633,Bread & Butter Chardonnay 2020,0.12,Rich gold colour visually. Butter aromatics. Strong oak presence with vanilla flavour suggests French Oak has been used. There is some pear and apple primary flavours with a dash of cream. This wine has great length which is exhibited by its long legs on the glass.

I drank it in good company with many delicious snacks, while sailing on the Dutch IJsselmeer. Rating of this 'terroir' almost 5/5. Only the weather could be a bit better. Some rain didn't spoil the Friday afternoon, but it would be nice to have a bit more wind and to see the sun for only a minute."

Conclusion: Quirky American number, but ultimately amazeballs!"

Ripe berries come through on the palate along with some spicy sweetness and oak with hints of dark chocolate at end - pretty consistent with winery’s and others descriptions. Well balanced light-medium tannins. Decanted for one hour. Started at 3.5, but grew on me with time ... and sips (3.7). "
865,Cantine di Ora Amicone 2017,0.05,"Today I have been rating wines for 2 years! What a journey it has been.

Had this one as a bottle a couple of years ago and now as a bib 😱! Its easter and all the kids are off from school so who can blame me!

This one is rather good. Purple red with dark berries and plum on the nose. Balanced and medium bodied with blackberry, vanilla, plum, raisins and chocolate mocca on the end. Quite soft finnish with hardly any tannins. 4🌟"
866,Cantine di Ora Amicone 2017,0.0,"Nose: very subdued. Faint hint of raisin or prune. Taste: Medium to heavy tannin. Plum skin. Pomegranate. Long low acid, high salt finish. A solid 4.0. Initially tried this one by itself. It really pops with some manchego cheese. "
867,Cantine di Ora Amicone 2017,0.05,"I definitely enjoyed this 2017 vintage wine out of the Veneto region of Italy.  Its bouquet was slightly off in my opinion, but the taste, once on the tongue, more than made up for the bouquet.  Had the bouquet been more pleasant, I probably would have given this vino a 4.5.  Overall, this wine is of medium body, smooth, with hints of plum, oak, and dark chocolate. Tannins show a touch after its finish, but rounds out this nice red wine. 🍷🇮🇹  Worth trying... a definite yes!"
868,Cantine di Ora Amicone 2017,0.05,"Surprisingly good for the price. I think that it helps that it’s a 2017 in 2022. Lots of nice umami secondaries: chicken broth, Italian herbs, bay leaf, lamb. Complex. Not big in the mouth, but very balanced, with adequate fruit (currently) to round it out. Not thick or overdone. Good enough to drink on its own. 4.0 woofs = Excellent, as I’ll likely buy more. But do drink it up soon. Value."
869,Cantine di Ora Amicone 2017,0.07,3.8 ⭐️ Corvina on its own gives us the medium bodied and smooth Italian.  Tart red fruit notes with balsamic tones it’s fair tannin and acidity keep the wine balanced. Available online  at Vivino for $16.94

I say that to let you know that it' a great wine when you want to be fancy AF, yet your pocketbook is like ""I don't think so"".  Since it's cava it's made in the Chanpagne method. The wine is a ovely pale gold color with aromas of peaches, apples, and toast. It's very good friendly.

984,Chardonnay 2018,0.06,I am a huge fan of this winery and decided to try their Chardonnay. Glad I did!  It had a citrus bouquet and tastes slightly oakey. We love oak with our chard and could have enjoyed more. We typically drink cheaper chards but could appreciate the balance this wine brings. It has modest tannins well dispositioned with the flavor. Excellent wine!

994,Chardonnay 2018,0.06,"Delicious and amazing quality for the price. Light golden color. Nose of lemon citrus, apple and mild oak. Palate is led by lemon curd, mild pear and toasted almonds with pleasant minerality on the finish. Medium intensity, medium light body, dry and medium plus acidity. Paired well with chicken asada salad ¡Salud!"
995,Chardonnay 2018,0.06,"Pineapple, white peach, butter and loads of oak. Delicate and rich without being overly buttery. Palate has some pleasant citrus notes and a fresh zesty finish that lingers. Still had enough body to pair with a paella and a nice acidity to cut through the richness. Excellent value."
996,Chardonnay 2018,0.13,"Clear pale yellow. Medium + intense nose of citrus, yeast, apricot, smoke, peach, honey, oak, vanilla. 

Butter, oak, lemon, peach and vanilla dominates the palate.

Remarkable roasting of the oak barrel. 

Good value. "

999,Chardonnay 2018,0.06,4.2 Excellent wine. I don’t like it quite as much as the 2017 vintage but still excellent. Green apple and lemon are the main fruits I get alongside a yeast note that caries a white pepper/ green peppercorn spice and lemon pith bitter finish. Lovely acidity. I suspect the bottles I cellared will age well. 
1000,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.05,"A very muscular CCR that I brought to a dinner party last night. 100% Sangiovese that was very fruit forward.
Opened with a core of plum and raspberry with notes of licorice and spice mid palate. Finishes with a whiff of tobacco.
Full and balanced with a vibrant fruit stream. Paired great with cheese appetizer and chicken in heavy chickpea sauce. And at $25 priced well for a 4.1 Reserva.
The party guests were pleased with my selection and drained the bottle."
1001,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"Loved this Chianti! Very smooth initially, with a hint of dusty tannins in the end. Violets, plum and light taste of chocolate. "

Delicate, but strong tannins, high acidity, and long finish.
Great vintage!"
1003,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.08,"Juicy and warm, with vanilla and blackberries. More like a Zinfandel than a traditional dry Chianti. Acidic, soft mouth feel. Really lovely."
1004,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"Great pairing with pasta family loved it, and never had this wine before. They Were very surprised with how well the Chianti paired with the food. "
1005,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.09,"4.0 - red fruit, sandstone, and a hint of Orange peel. Doesn’t have the finish of a higher end reserva, but still a good value Chianti. "
1006,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.09,"Solid Chianti. Picked it up at La Note in OakPark, IL. Dry, earthy, medium bodied wine. The wine had hints of leather and red fruit. "
1007,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"Dry, medium body, high acidity, and chalky tannins. Nose is blackberry, clay, earth. Palate is cherry, cranberry, baking spice. Cherry finish. "

1010,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.07,"Leather, cocoa nose. Not a lot of fruit. On the tongue first blueberry and dark fruit. Coffee notes follow. Short finish, with soft tannins. Med+ acid. Very enjoyable."

1019,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,A very good Chianti Classico Riserva. But ttill too young. It started to open up after 5hrs of air. It needs at least three more years on the bottle. It offers a great value. 
1020,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"Very good. Tastes fruity, like cherry or strawberry. It’s dry. It’s acidic. Has an earthy feel. Would go well with any food, pasta, meat, whatever. Drank at Emily’s tasting. Would drink again"

1023,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"Good in tertiary developing: earthy, mushroom and animal. Dried herbs notes show the variety typical characters. Well-defined fruity concentration. Completed and together. Not enough in integration. "
1024,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.07,"4 🤩

A good Chianti that expresses way more of that dried fruit and potpourri, dried herbs like fennel on the nose, together with some red fruit.

Tongue is pretty oaky, with cherry and some solid fruit tannins in the front.

Acidity is good, mouthfeel is good. "
1025,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.15,"Nice ruby red colour with earth tones and oak on the nose. Slightly tannic due to young age but fruir forward and lots of flavour: red fruit, leather raspberry, and tobacco come to
mind and great value."
1026,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.06,"Tasting the 2016 now. Leather, game nose, toasted oak, white peppers, Mandarin citrus, brown sugar, figs, red cherries. The palate is...

Happy Sangiovese Friday everyone! 
We were visiting the local LCBO in Brandon MB and were happy to find this ‘16 CCR.
Dark cherry, cocoa, earthy, dusty. Med tannins. Easy drinkin’. Cheers y’all. 🍷 "
1028,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"Hat tip to @[1|3976971|DCLaxfan] for the recommendation!  This is an excellent Chianti and great value at $25.  Red plum, pomegranate, licorice, tobacco and a hint of smoke.  Med+ bodied and very restrained velvetty tannins (medium I’d say and well integrated).  I will definitely look for this one again.  8/10"
1029,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.06,"My second try on the 2016 vintage and third overall. I confirm my previous score. Very good wine, earthy and red fruit notes with the oaky undertones. Dry, pleasantly acidic and tannic. It further improves with some aeration. I really like it. "
1030,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.1,"Thanks to exchange policy at Jacques, this beauty cost me just 4 € instead of 16 - I got a refund for the oxidized bottle of the Tuscan red I reported yesterday. 🤩Medium to full body Chianti, typical, with beautiful ripe fruit and integrated oak note. Cherry, raspberry, blackberry, herbs, tobacco. Cooly nose with some medicinal notes.   Pleasant complexity, present but smooth tannins, lively acidity bringing structure and freshness. Medium finish. Great pairing with pasta and tomato / aubergine sauce. "
1031,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"Happy Sangiovese Friday and Italian Chianti #97!  This is a wonderful CCR that I've had a few times and this time I decanted for 2 hours and it definitely helped increase the level of fresh red cherries along with flavors of leather, violet and Tuscan earth.  Very dry wine and great with pizza. "
1032,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.11,"Very oaky nose. Through the 1h in decanter and glass it smoothened out a bit, but remained quite strong as the first aroma. Some dark fruit, blackberries, boysenberries, some tobacco and hints of herbs. Quite complex, but still what annoys me is how the oak dominated.

Palate is similar: concentration, complexity, mix of aromas are all there. Oak is first, fruit follows, herbs third. Quite a big body, medium acidity. This wine has some potential. Something I would like to revisit in 10 years."
1033,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"A truly symphonic nose. Cooked black cherry, strawberry, and a touch of honey, smoke, lilac, wet rocks, all in harmony. Not particularly leggy. Palate on the dry side, firm tannins and excellent structure, tastes lovely though in truth the aroma is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Fairly acidic with a modest finish. Excellent pairing with a garlicky red sauce."
1034,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.1,"Really good stuff...2016 a gr8 year and it shows!  Drinking elegantly now, yet has black fruits, leather and tannin enough to last a good few years.  Vegetal aromas, lead onto to a ruby red visage, the palate doesn't disappoint, with backdrop of dark chocolate that is led first by umami flavours of truffles and strong bark fruits.  Balanced, careful use of oak, well made & super elegant...medium bodied.  WHY is this £10.60 here on Denners in Préverenges, Switzerland and in England around £21!?  😎🍷🇮🇹"
1035,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.05,"I’m into this Chianti! Dark maroon color, with an acidic smell on the nose. Oaky and earthy flavors balanced with a deep red fruit note. Easy drinking and paired great with food. Was even smoother the second day when I finished the bottle 🤪 

Loved drinking this at Keyah Grande with @[1|50229936|James Beecham] and Carter during pasta night and shooting day."
1036,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.05,"Happy Sangiovese Friday! Dark ruby, with red and black fruit, floral scents, earth and herbal notes on the expressive nose. Dry, m body, m acidity, 13.5% ABV, smooth tannins, m+ finish. Raspberries, blackberries, currants, fine tannins, woody notes, and black pepper on the palate. Finishes with lingering fruit and black pepper. Paired with Fried Calamari with tomato sauce, and Margarita Pizza at our favorite Pizza Restaurant."
1037,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.06,"Carpineto CCR is, well, classic.  Sangiovese and Canaiolo.  Deep ruby. Tobacco and cherry nose. First sip was green, but it opened and settled into oak - with chalky, earthy, grippy tannins that stick to the throat.  Would have been better faster if we had decanted.  Much better than the  Carpineto CC!  3.9 "
1038,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.0,"Spontaneous action with the neighbors:
Let’s have dinner together - they order Pizza and I will bring the according wine 😀👍

On the nose: vine ripened tomato leaf, balsamic, sweet tobacco, leather, smoke, cherry and a touch of strawberry. On the palate: the wine is dry, medium body and medium alcohol.

Paired with tonight’s dinner of tortellini stiffed with spicy Italian sausage with a side of rapini. 92pts. "

1042,Chianti Classico Riserva 2016,0.05,"Dark fruit such as raspberries on the palate and the nose make this an elegant wine that is easy to drink with or without food. It does have a big structure and strong vigilent tannins that allow for  some time in your cellar. This wine is phenomenal with meats, red sauces, and other hearty meals. It is also good with bold hard cheeses. I even like it on its own,  but you do have to let it breath a minute."

Shows fruit-forward, bold but smooth, black fruit and oak dominant. "
1255,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.0,Very dry it's a great sipping wine. It is not bitter. I like dry wines if they are not bitter. If you don't like dry this is not for you.

1265,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.0,"Let me tell you that for years I was relegade on buying this wine, today was my first time tasting it, it’s good but Cab Sauvignon  from Lodi is a very different taste from Sonoma or Nap"

1269,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.13,"Vivino is on point. On sale at 27$ raises this given its price has been 25-30$ consistently for >5yrs. Lots of chocolate, coffee, leather, vanilla, aged red fruit and black fruit that still plays more like a Lodi Zinfandel than a Lodi CS. At 14.5% it brings a balanced heat on a gorgeous return to summer in BC. 3.9/5"
1270,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.0,"Dark black purple.  Dark currant with a hint of chocolate taste. Nowadays, I guess you can find a wine label about anything, like. mermaid, prisoner, any animals, sisters, but on a freak show? I have to ask why?"
1271,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.23,"Really impressed by this Californian CS!
Deep garnet colour in the glass. On the nose red fruit, smoke, tobacco and oak.

Big black fruit bouquet with vanilla and oak notes. 

Body is big and dense, with lots of tannins and nearly balanced acidity. Blackberry, black cherry, vanilla, and pipe tobacco round out the palate. 

Very good, however I am left curious as to how this would age. It might have some great cellar potential! 

Either way a solid 3.9 ⭐️ today!"
1277,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.14,"Deep purple with a nose of blackberries and black cherries. In the glass, a consistent mix of blackberries, black cherries, plums, cola, allspice, anise and vanilla. Long black fruit, anise and vanilla finish.

"
1279,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.0,"Spending the night in West Yellowstone, after a full day of touring. I opened up this fun Cabernet that is medium body to cap off the night.

1281,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.05,"I’ve had this Freak Show Cab before but not this vintage. All Michael David wines seem to be high quality and very tasty. This Cab is a dark ruby color with near bold aromas and flavors of blueberry, soft cassis, raspberry and mellow oak aging. What I really enjoy is the smooth almost soft texture of the wine that allows you palate to feel the flavors and enjoy them fully. Just a touch dry and very nicely balanced overall. Quite enjoyable!   (4.0)"
1282,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.0,"A rather interestig cab sauv from Cali. A sticker on the side reads ""American Winery of the year, 2020: Wine Enthisiast"", and it could be somewhat true... A good wine overall, with a lot of plums and a sweet finish with almost no alcoholic or tannins taste, yet a bold one with a lot of character. Interesting, enjoyable with a platter of cheeses and jam, maybe some light meats. "

1292,Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon 2018,0.07,"Fruity, well-balanced and apparently a good value.  Nice cab, with notes of red fruits and cherry.  Seemed a bit young in that it was acidic and on the verge of being harsh.  Went well with a steak dinner, and definitely a promising label.  "

1300,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Review number 3,000! Perfectly dry, light, and crisp. Simple, with terrific foam-like carbonation and a tart green apple profile with just a touch of yeast. Paired with cinnamon and pecan rolls this morning as we decorate for Christmas. Perfect! 🎄 "

Good value (often on sale). "
1303,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"A nice balance between elements; crisp-tart, peach-green melon, ripe pear-green apple. Lots of aromas to play off continuous bubbles."
1304,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Quite well balanced. Taste like any other Prosecco. Green apple and pear. After taste indeed of butter brioche. Lovely bubbles, pale yellow"
1305,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Quite nice! Fresh and crisp, with some great green apple, and citrusy flavors. No harsh finish... like a lots of pros Ecco nowadays..."

1311,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,liked this prosecco! Has a bit more complexity than regular ones in this price range. Good apple and citrus notes with a soft mouthfeel. Enjoyed it a lot and great value! 
1312,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.05,"Selection from cellar for Champagne and Mimosas bar for Jack's Quarantine 17th Birthday Brunch. Served with John Wayne Eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, fruit salad & cinnamon strudel muffins with our family of four 3/29/2020. Notes of tart green apple & brioche. Name Garbel means fresh & dry, and perfectly describes this Prosecco! An inexpensive favorite of ours from our friends at Quail Distribution."
1313,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Nose of melon and honeysuckle with mild notes of citrus and cedar. Flavor starts dry with mineral note and rapidly progresses to a strong raw honey middle through finish. Prefect for drinking by itself, or Saturday morning mimosas."
1314,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Apt. Wills bday rooftop. This is a 4.0 mostly for the price. It’s nothing crazy special but certainly enjoyable and would get again for group activities / casual drinking. Hint of green apple, stone, rosemary and a bit of white pepper. Honeydew melon. Some saline. Really quite nice and getting a lot out of it for something so inexpensive "
1315,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,This procsecco is the complete opposite of what you typically get in a Italian sparking. It is bone dry- almost to the point of no flavor. Its great for champagne cocktails because it doesn’t add extreme sweetness but has the bubbles you are looking for. Glad I found it. 
1316,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"A very fresh clean Prosecco with a degree of sweetness, I'd say closer to an Extra Dry style.  Fresh apple and pear notes subtle sweet floral/yeast notes.  A solid bottle to replace Asti for the New Year."

Paired with a chef tasting menu from soled olives, truffle pasta, and wood fired chicken. "
1320,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"I'm not much for sparkling wines but this is a very well balanced example. Not too dry, not to sugary sweet, this is mama bear, right in the middle. If your like me and dread the bubbles this is your bubbly. 4/5 stars. "
1321,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Deep strawlike color, nose with hints of orange blossom and white peach.  Light body, moderate bubbles, and dry with medium acidity.  It starts with a more tropical base with a hint of yeast and papaya over top of the standard melon evolving more acidity towards the end finishing with simple lemon. Refreshing and relatively complex. Good."
1322,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Nice! This is probably one of my favorite bottles of Prosecco so far. Generally I’m not much of a fan of this style, as in sparkling wine I gravitate more towards champagne and traditional method. However, this was a beautifully complex and interesting example with notes of lime, pear, and Candy apple on the nose. A refreshing amount of acidity on the palate and a strong bead."
1323,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Had heard good things about this one but a little disappointed to be honest. It has a nice chalky minerality to it but lacks much in the way of the tart apple/pear flavors that my favorite Proseccos have. Worth trying especially if you like your Proseccos very dry and minerally but I feel like something is missing.

Edit: bumping this up half a star as the flavors came out a bit more after a few sips and the balance is much better. I spoke too soon!"
1324,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"More Vitamin P to beat the Kansas City heat!

Just a slightly better than average Prosecco, this has good minerality and apples.  Not bad for the price!"
1325,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Pale lemon with youthful jasmine flower, lemon, pear, and green apple peel aromas. Delicate mousse. A solidly made wine, though lacking depth or intrigue. Delightful."
1326,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,More dry than most Proseccos we have had. Not normal a fan. Quite nice with herbed goat cheese stuffed endive and stuffed mushrooms. 
1327,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"green apples, a hint of honey, freshly baked bread and minerals. Lively small bubbles. Good acidity. Lovely aperitif."
1328,Garbèl Prosecco Brut N,0.0,"Pale yellow filled by puffs of intense, tiny bubbles.  Starts with green apples and finishes with stinging, dry bubbles."

My memory isn’t accurate enough to compare this newest vintage to those in the past. Best I can say is it must be as good. Deep rich ruby colour with a modest+ nose of dark berries, cherry, plum and well oak barrel aged.  Flavours are much the same with a sense of a smooth full body texture and a fairly even overall balance. Quite enjoyable. "

1372,Golden Reserve Malbec 2019,0.18,"Oak must and blackberry on the nose, lovely thick plum, blackberry leather and sawn wood vanilla palate and a glorious mouthfeel, bramble pepper tickling the plush yet shortish exit. Lovely fruit, a certain beguiling sweetness too that feels right for the deep fruit drupe-heave. A mist of coolness at the back of tongue adds to the intrigue, don’t know what this is but I like it a lot, notes of mocha too and cliches aside a lick of liquorice. 
Very nice on the back of the tongue. 
"
1373,Golden Reserve Malbec 2019,0.14,"This was fairly fruit driven at first but after time in the decanter it really improved to show well integrated secondary oak, earthy, leather notes with blackberry, black cherry and plum. Good acidity, dry and a decent finish. Definitely decant"

1375,Golden Reserve Malbec 2019,0.22,"I know that is a just prejudice but whenever I touched these sort, I feel european wines are overrated for appraisal and reputations and also that tags.

1376,Golden Reserve Malbec 2019,0.11,"A 4.2 Reserva Malbec that is  delightfully exquisite! It is semi-dry, with medium velvety tannins and soft acidity and a strong full body. Beautiful nose of blended plums, raspberry and cherry. On palate and mouth oaky, with ripe dark fruits, and vanilla & dark chocolate hints. Its complexity is enhanced by the suave texture and balanced acidity. Touch of spices creates a fascinating end in the long finish process. A very flavorful aftertaste. Good buy."
1377,Golden Reserve Malbec 2019,0.05,"Weird Thursday evening, popped into local Majestic for their first wine tasting in about 2 years (more to come on that) & then on way home dropped into Tesco for food shopping & just had to take advantage of their 25% off wine sale. This Malbec for £9 is a steal, mellow soft silky tannin with flavours of raspberry, plum & red current. Med bodied with good acidity & a rich toasted oaky vanilla finish. Perfect autumn wine with left over beef, carrot & red wine casserole and creamy buttery mashed potatoes 3.8⭐️"

Some cake spice on the nose. Interesting effects of oak on the palate. The combination of perfume, smoke, caramel, and fresh dark cherry makes it complicated to compare with other Cab Sauvé wines.

It’s got black cherry, dark fruit and chocolate! It almost had a sherry vibe about it. It’s not 100% primitivo, but it tastes like it is. Negroamaro, the other grape used in it, is very complimentary to the primitivo it seems. This is a new discovery from a store that I usually dismiss. I will however be going back to it because it has good stuff and you really can’t beat the prices."

1616,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.08,"Soft and fruity tastes from red and black fruits. Engaging citrus juices, light enough to show layers of additional flavors and aromas and so easy to drink"
1617,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.08,It’s the colour of port and a fabulous mouthful of dark fruit. The 14% abv gives it a good round feel too. It’s ‘Jam Shed’ for grownups. Frankly it’s a bargain. 
1618,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.0,"One of the best QPR. That price and that character. It is not the best wine I drink for sure but one of the wine I will not forget :). Fruityness, acidity, sugar in a nice harmony. 4.1"
1619,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.0,"It’s been a year since I rated this and having gone back to it so many times, I feel it deserves an upvote. It definitely is on the sweeter side but for the price this is a great bottle of wine! "
1620,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.17,"Cherry color, aromatic, elegant with good intensity. Memories of ripe black fruit, scrubland, balsamic. Background with touches of noble leather and vanilla. Persistent and elegant finish"

🌟 4,5 / 5, the normal price is €4,99, you don't often find this quality of wine at this price. If you see it... buy it! "
1627,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.22,"Black cherry in colour and fruitiness hits the nose, not that usual for a Spanish wine. On the palette the fruit explodes,  blackberry, cherry and vanilla wrapped up with that balanced smoke and oak with a subtle hint of licorice. It’s big, bold, fruity, smooth and I love it! Definitely a future guilty pleasure, unusual fruitiness for a Spanish wine and for the price… amazing value! "
1628,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.0,"Definite super positive surprise of the day. No illusions: it is table wine. Yet, to get such charming aroma of cherry and raspberry in such full body wine for such price… Felix Solis company, bravo, guys! That is why you are so respected in the wine world. "
1629,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.12,"This Spanish red is very unique & delicious. Fruit forward with some interesting complexity. It is an amazing buy at under $12!!!! It is medium purple in color. Has blackberry, leather, tobacco, and  plum on the nose. It’s dry with  medium body, medium tannins, and medium (+) acidity. On the palate there is sweeten blackberry, black fruit, vanilla, and black currant.

I really enjoyed this wine and will definitely buy more bottles. Great wine to serve to guests during the holidays! Easy drinker for sure."

Highly recommendable!"
1634,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.0,"Having had several bottles of this wine… you’re foolish if you don’t try this wine. Seriously this man has nailed this wine. We just had it with filet mignonette, unbelievable there’s none left , sorry!"
1635,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.2,"A guilty pleasure, if a little on the sweeter side. It is superb value and oh so easy to drink. Deep purple colour with lovely earthy aromas. Medium body with low tannins. Well rounded dark fruits, particularly plum and black currant, with vanilla and oak notes too. Not a very complicated or complex wine, and I fear next time I try it it will be underwhelming, but at his price I don’t mind at all. "
1636,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.06,"Great spanish red. Totally low profile and simple. Sophistication is in the essence. Cherry ripe and power push fruit, a little balsamic tingle in back throat, Tempranillo with Syrah at a great balance and plus: smoothness, leather and a slight mineral touch. Incredible value for money! "
1637,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.06,"One of my favourite reds. Full bodied, smooth and a good balance of tannins. Deep red Tampranillo with dark fruit such as plum,  blackcurrant, blackberry present. On the nose also pleasant. We drank it with pork cordon bleu and it was a good compliment. "
1638,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.0,"Very fragrant nose with aromas of blackberries, sour cherries, dark plums, smoke, leather and peppery notes. On the mouthfeel light-medium bodied quite complex flavors with silky tannins and fresh acidity. The finish is medium long, soft with a tasteful sour taste of berries, cherries and plums with an underlying mineral character.
for not too much money this is a beautiful table wine par excellence."
1639,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.1,"This is a fascinating Spanish wine, that does not drink like an Old World bottle.  Intensely fruity nose of blackberry, blueberry, tobacco and vanilla.  Full bodied with luscious ripe fruit on the palate, and while it is a bit of a fruit bomb it’s got just enough structure and earthy notes to keep it balanced and just make it plain delicious!   14.5% alcohol, medium acid, moderate tannins, definitely a crowd pleaser.  A unique blend of Tempranillo and Syrah, and a non-vintage wine, fascinating indeed… recommended!"
1640,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.0,"Lovely dark flavour aroma…..almost sweet. Lovely soft texture and smooth to drink. Raspberry and blackberry flavour. Really like this for summer drinking. Just what you expect a nice, bold, modest priced, Spanish wine to be."
1641,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.11,"Definitely the best QPR I have ever seen so far. Deep cherry-red color. Nose full of black fruits and black berries. Mouth is changing from fruity jam to oak, pepper, minerals. Round body, low tannins, slight sweetness. Just take the bottle from the fridge, open it and enjoy the dinner. No need to wait for the right temperature, no need to let it breath. Excellent label! Simple things do not need to be complicated. Just enjoy..."
1642,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.0,Very nice spanish wine with a very fun label. It’s like a medium strength berry-forward situation that’s very nice and pleasant. Kind of summery but also it’s summer and I want to drink it right now. 4.2🌟
1643,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.07,"Very good wine! Great in nose and mouth. Easy to drink, even without food, but will be fantastic with red meat and grilled vegetables. Full of red fruits in nose and mouth. Value for money! Highly recommended!"
1644,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.06,The syrah component really adds some fruitiness and jaminess to this tempranillo. Still full bodied and dark fruited but closer to a pays d'oc red than a spanish tempranillo. Packs a punch but goes down easily. Stunningly good value for the price. Recommended
1645,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.06,"An exceptional wine. A deep purple  colour. A complex aroma including vanilla, coffee and black friluit. On the palate there is cherry, plum, jam and some nutty notes. Pleasant tannins. Soft and round with delicate acidity. Good value for money. "
1646,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.09,"A really good find in Tesco UK. This Spanish wine is fruity with some spice. Tastes of plum, vanilla and pepper, but not too strong of a peppery taste."
1647,Mucho Más Tinto NV,0.0,"Very distinguished and an amazing experience for the price. It’s in a category of it’s own, almost in the tawny port wine territory of flavors and especially aromas. Very sugary, dark, ripe cherry, plum, raisin, super dense and creamy/nutty even, it also has that beautiful purple Tempranillo color. This bottle is amazing, mad respect to the winemaker, even though this is not quite my style, I appreciate how much you get from this one. It perfectly shows just how many faces the same grape can have."

1663,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.09,Fabulous red but 7 of us had to share it. Big fruit with well integrated wood sorry I am too tired after walking 9 kilometres in the Mournes to do better
1664,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.08,Very good wine. We totally got an apricot scent as the strongest smell. It also has a subtle apricot taste. Disagree with the calls of tobacco and dark fruits.
1665,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,Great blend from Allegrini….dark fruity taste nicely deep for a sub $20 bottle of wine.  After much deliberation I officially name this the House bottle.
1666,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.08,"Another good vintage of this wine. Tasted this in a blind tasting and was able to tell that the wine is Italian right away. Aromas of cherry, vanilla, and white pepper. "

1668,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.07,"2018 vintage, drank early 2022. Nose of cherry, strawberry and oak. Bold & dry with medium plus acidity but mild tannins. Flavors of cherry and leather with spice on a long finish. Very nice!"
1669,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.05,"4.2 for me. Definitely worth it for 16 euros.

Dried mint, lovely toasty tobacco oak like it's amarone big brother.
Baked strawberries.
Dry, medium-minus bodied and well balanced, a touch high on the acid, but I'll accept it. A few more years will do it very well, buy now!


Tried another bottle 6 months later. Lovely complexity. Turkish delight, liquorice, dried herbs and mint. Tar. Beaut."
1670,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,"The 2018 vintage is not quite as good as the 2017, but still quite wonderful!  Currently one of my favorite wines for classic Italian flavor."
1671,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.06,"4.25, here we are in 2018 my fourth year to experience this wonderful, reasonably priced, northern Italian red. Cherry, oak and spice combine for a easy drinking experience. A wine thatI will buy and enjoy, year after year. Hats off to Franco Allegrini for developing the process that produces this wine."
1672,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.2,"Nose: smoke, plum jam, leather, red fruit, raisins, prunes

A beautiful dark-red color. Average acidity, pleasantly refreshing. A velvety texture with a wonderful, round tobacco tannin. A very rich palette of flavors: plum, blueberry, chocolate, plum jam, vanilla, cherry, raisins. Lots of barrel notes: oak and vanilla. Perfectly balanced with a long finish. Phenomenal PQR. Superb!"
1673,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,"Solid 4 stars. Nice dry northern Italian red blend, it paired perfectly with our beef and pasta dinner:)
Tastes more expensive than it was, and I will be buying some of the 2019 asap!
Give this one a try!"
1674,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.05,"Always a good baby Amarone (in an honest sense) and easy to notice vintage differences and styles (which I like). This has some seriously trying chalky tannins now but the dark fruit and smoky roast pepper are lovely. Juicy but sun-dried-juicy. Savoury elements dominate. Fig, mocha and perhaps black olive brine. Perfect weight in the mouth and level of complexity to match a dinner of MOTD, olives and a battle with a crossword. 4⭐️ and in 2+ years certainly more 😋"
1675,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,"Paired this bottle with food from Italian Osteria, one of my favourite restaurants in the hood. A treat from Mum before I fly off for my holidays. Smooth, elegant and a drink mum would approve - notes of cherry, plums, slight earthy. Not too acidic. Love it with tagliolini with prawns, porchetta, baked pork belly wild fennel, ending with pistachio tiramisu. We finished the bottle easily. "
1676,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.06,"Dark garnet color with reserved nose of tobacco, ripe raspberries, and hints of geraniums. Palate is much less reserved, presenting fruit-forward cherry and raspberry layered with wood and balanced by assertive tannins that transition into a long finish of astringent tannins and mouthwatering acid."
1677,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.06,"On the nose, strong chocolate and ripe red fruit. Tasting notes include cherry, smoke, fresh tires, green peppercorn, stone, and blueberry. Long finish. Better than the 2017, imo. Wish I could rate 4.25."
1678,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.05,"A strong showing after we’ve stayed away from a couple vintage of the Palazzo Della Torre Veronese…full bodied in the Ripasso style , along with double fermentation. This is full of ripe red fruit and tea on the nose and palate. Medium acidity and med-low tannin, but enough to give it back one. A very very solid drinker and crowd pleaser for a high production wine around $15"
1679,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.1,"My 100th rating wine on Vivino. Pale ruby, Leather, Earth, Oak. Mixture with light red fruit smell. After 30mins Blackcurrant.  Raspberry taste. Medium+ Bold, Little dry, light tannin with quite high in acidity. A sweet note and lasting. A soft vino with character and with some Jazz music is perfecto for the evening. Price $50 with 18% disc. 
Finishing it on 6th day with some cheese cake, great compatiable. However, do not recommend to keep the vino for more than 4days after opening on cork without vacuum."
1680,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,"Thyme; arugula; basil; cherry; leather on the nose; similar on palate.  Leather & smoke.  Blackberry. palate plus chocolate and coffee. Dry; stone/dirt; tannic.  Bought by the glass at Luigi’s Coal Oven Pizza in Fort Lauderdale.
 Interesting & slightly unique profile flavor but in our wheelhouse.  Would absolutely drink again! $13/glass but half off during happy hour."
1681,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.13,"The best red of the night, this was absolutely gorgeous. Rich, velvety and fruity, with lots of blackberry. This has all the elements that you would expect from a rich and tannic Italian red without any of the elements being overpowering. There’s subtle oak on the palate, with sweet dark fruits and raspberry. This is followed by subtle tannins- so well balanced and moreish. "
1682,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.06,"Aromas of cherry, plum, dark chocolate, soft licorice, sage, oak & soft earth. Flavors include cherry, plum & oak, with balanced acidity & tannins. Full body with a dark chocolate & coffee finish. Medium rough texture with a dense firm structure. Amazing wine."

On the finish... Chocolate, Cedar and a touch of bitterness. This wine is a  wonderful value. Total Wine price is $12.97...a winter wine for sure. It will great with hearty Italian fare. Another note of interest this wine is made in a Ripassa style using 1/3 dried 🍇.."
1686,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,"It’s an interesting wine, coming from the region that gives amarone, this one reminds a lot of a California Pinot Noir instead, which is quite the opposite. Peppery notes on the nose, on the palate is red cherry, rhubarb and green bell pepper."
1687,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,A well balanced red - great to go with a lovely steak.  I love this type of red as I feel it has a good taste with a rich feeling.

1689,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,"Enjoyed! Bit of complexity here. Nose of black cherry,  and lots of it. But plenty of something burnt/bitter/rubber. Maybe tar. Nose is very different to palate which is more herbal and spicy, chocolate? Decent balance but a touch more acidity would help I think..."
1690,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,"An excellent QPR for this fruity blend of Corvina, Corvinone and Rondinella, with red cherries and plums. Medium bodied, medium+ acidity, ripe tannins and dry, it has flavors as in the nose with some herbal notes. Finishes medium long and juicy. Great with dishes containing red Italian sauces. "
1691,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.1,"If blind, I’d say a Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon😶 Sealed with a cheap recycled stopper, it’s ruby with dark purple hues in color & no signs of sediment. When served at ~18C, black currant picked with leaves is what hits your nose right upon opening. There’re also plum, walnut, some cherry, vanilla, bell pepper, oak, and mighty minerals— not especially complex or something but balanced & generally well-made. Medium finish. Mild and even aged cheese go fantastic with this blend. Overall: nice but overpriced🙄"
1692,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.06,"Beautiful ruby colour in the glass. Aromatic notes of red cherry, vanilla, chocolate, hints of plum. Leathery smooth on the palate - wow! Delish. Medium body with a beautiful medium+ finish. Slightly earthy. Would happily stock up on this"

1694,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,Note of rubber tires in a good way. A little spicy on the top of the tongue. A hint of smoke plum 乌梅 on the after-bud. Not complex but it has its personality thanks to the unique rubber tires aroma. 
1695,Palazzo della Torre 2018,0.0,"Lovely dark ruby colour, cherry on the nose. Chocolate plum and blackberries, on the palette.
Very enjoyable with beef rib."

An explosion of that fruit driven flavour on the tongue with some structure from maturation in oak. Light-to-medium tannins & very more-ish on the finish.

Pair with food with rich flavours like beef lasagne.😋🧀🍷"

1787,Pinot Noir,0.07,"I haven't had a pinot in ages, preferring first red blends and now OVZ. This would be perfect with a hearty steak cut, which I don't have just now. 

It's also not as heavy-handed as the pinots I remember.  This has a nice balance of spices and fruits with a crisp, almost effervescent finish. "
1788,Pinot Noir,0.12,"In my opinion, one of the best in California Pinot Noirs.

Deep garnet with ruby rim and mellow legs.

Nose of raspberries with cedar and moss.

Opening of red fruit favoring plums with leather, vanilla, warm toast and a fade of slate.

Light bodied and low acidity with perfect tannins that emerge and fade respectfully.

Just beautiful!"
1789,Pinot Noir,0.0,"What a great great surprise. I wouldn’t actually expect Pinot noir to be so sweet, complex, yet medium bodied and incredibly tasteful. So I traded it with a friend of mine for a bottle of previously rated Pessimist. "

My new favorite Pinot Noir. "
1791,Pinot Noir,0.07,Hands down the best Pinot. Not a Pinot fan but this is as close as you can get to a dark Cab. Always get this when I eat seafood. Cherry and sweet vanilla with a smooth oaky smoke finish. Love this wine for the price 
1792,Pinot Noir,0.06,Delicious and syrupy (this is good for me 👍) Pinot Noir!  Lots of chewy vanilla bean and a hint of tamed ripen raspberries.  This is my second favorite 🤩 Pinot—- Lola is my #1 🥇.  Beautiful long finish that lingers on the palate.  HIGHLY recommended!  Drink young!  It is a N.V. so kind of hard to say drink periods.
1793,Pinot Noir,0.07,"Was expecting a light/medium bodied PN as most often the PN that I buy are weak and underwhelming. This is an exception. Stronger at the medium end and intense. Smooth yet spicy notes, berry fruits although no real cherry flavour that i liked in some Burgundian PNs. Buy again."
1794,Pinot Noir,0.05,"An excellent Pinot Noir at a very good price point. This wine is easily found and enjoyable. Not sure if there is a better Pinot for the price. Ruby colored, with the aroma of ripe red fruit, with just a hint of leather. On the palate, I taste ripe fruit, with a nice lingering after taste. I paired with grilled steaks and bake potatoes, very very good. Medium tannins and body. Not a heavy red, smooth enough to sip after dinner on the patio. Find a bottle and enjoy,"
1795,Pinot Noir,0.16,"A surprising Californian Pinot Noir. Rich with flavor but not heavy.  Cherry , strawberry , oak , vanilla and blackberry. Very smooth and easy to drink. Pairs well with a steak or any other meat dish. "
1796,Pinot Noir,0.07,"Baking spice, dark cherry, vanilla, honey -did I say baking spice! Sweet and syrupy on the finish. I like it but not! I’m conflicted. Kind of like an after dinner drink. We rated it a 4.5 before. Two votes of 4.0 and 4.5. "
1797,Pinot Noir,0.17,"A distinct PN with a pleasant nose, smooth palette and complex finish. Rich with red fruit on the palette and dark fruit on the finish. Oak throughout. There is a pleasant sparkle of acidity up front on the palette and a mild sweetness."
1798,Pinot Noir,0.07,"Californian PN fruits on the nose. Strawberries with gentle dusty tannins. Wonderfully full.

Amazingly full, sweet palate. Tons of fruits and strawberry marmalade. A somewhat shorter finish rounds it off. 

Quite brilliant. Heavy like a quality primitivo. "
1799,Pinot Noir,0.26,"An un-Pinot Pinot. Sweet cinnamon, black currant, cocoa,

1819,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"Crisp, clean and smooth. Very well balanced and flavorful, yet not overpowering. The main flavor is grapefruit, with an aftertaste of lime peel.

1820,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.07,Solid 4.25 potentially 4.5. Really nice and refreshing. Passion fruit on the nose and initial taste. Really balanced between sweetness and acidity. The finish still remains very balanced and rounds out to be a very nice Sav.

1824,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.07,Crisp mineral and tropical fruit. Perfect with crab and dori on a Thai beach. Better than most Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc with an enjoyable finish without any bitter notes. Pleasantly effervescent to the last drop.
1825,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"I was very impressed by this Sauvignon Blanc, hailing from Marlborough in New Zealand. It represents a great value, and was enjoyable to drink mid-week with a variety of foods - curry chicken and the next night pasta - great with both. The nose is so typical for a New Zealand x Sauv Blanc, with lemongrass, lime and citrus, intense minerality, floral notes, and abundant smoke. The wine itself is fresh and vivid, with citrus and mineral the prime notes. Lingering finish that is tart and smoky, and yet elegant"
1826,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"A delicious SB. I’ve now had four bottles of this wine. Strong grapefruit and lemon flavors, papaya, very crisp but juicy. Paired perfectly with a grilled chicken lemon pasta. Excellent value as well. "
1827,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"Just did a side by side comparison between a 2020 and a 2021. A stark contrast in one year. Both dry Sauvignon blancs — but the 2021 was bursting with citrus — a mix of lemon, green apple, pineapple, pear and melon — all lingering on a delicious finish. The 2020 had a very abrupt finish."
1828,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.05,"Villa back at its best!  Villa was the favourite tipple of a dear friend taken far too early, so glad it is back to its best. Very pale straw colour. Lots of crisp green apple on the nose with lemon zest. Lots of fantastic acidity and lime on first taste, has your mouth watering. Moved on to gooseberry and a tropical fruit finish. Crisp ad dry. At £10 at Tesco this is top value for money. I got it on offer at £8. Could drink all day long. "
1829,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"This perfectly encapsulates the characteristics of a Sauvignon Blanc. 

Like Stellenbosch in South Africa, Marlborough is fast becoming another one of my favourite places for wine production.

Big hits of grass, gooseberry, lemon and apple. I even picked up a hint of melon which added some sweetness that I really enjoyed. 

Dry, high acidity, medium alcohol with a long finish - what a superb wine at a great price point. This one’s a keeper and etches it’s way onto my favourites list which is coming along nicely."
1830,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.07,"The undisputed king of SB under $20 a bottle. Absolutely delicious. Citrus and tropical notes, vanilla, honeysuckle and just a very slight hint of grapefruit. Some nice mineral notes in the finish. Paired with Chicken scallopini "
1831,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.04,"As a NZ Sauvignon Blanc fan, Villa Maria’s proposal is usually sort of a mainstream standard delivery that I love. The 2021 vintage is another example of maintaining excellent level, even though I on a second attempt it felt slightly less impressive. Pale straw colour, nose of gooseberry, citrus, green apple. Light-to-medium body with forward-placed acidity which works amazingly with the overall crispiness. Green pear, apple, kiwi and tropical fruit on the palate. Light, dry and very zesty finish."

1833,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"Wow.  This is delish. Super aromatic and refreshing, this is a great summer sipper. Grapefruit nectarine, pineapple and asparagus with fresh green grassy notes. In the palate the citrus is dominated by grapefruit and lime, more pineapple with a gentle minerality and subtle green notes "
1834,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"What a pleasant surprise!
Having tried rather mediocre whites recently, this one really stands out.
Nose is eventually sweeter than of average NZ SB - grapefruit, mint, rhubarb, gooseberry, fresh hay and jasmine.
Palate feels a lot heavier than usual SB, lots of body. Sharply acidic at first sip, but a tiny amount of residual sugars is also there. White currant, apple, raw pineapple and honey. Slightly fizzy.
I am really sorry that we had only one bottle for tonight. More, please! "
1835,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.05,"Pale lemon color and full of tropical fruit and citrus aromas such as melon, guava,  pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Soooo crisp from the very first and balance between acidity and a bit of sweetness at the end is one of the best among S.B. I've ever tried. Abundant fruity aroma is the main characteristics of this wine and crispy texture seems to be protrude than other vintages."

1837,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"This really is a great vintage. Everything just works, from the nose of tomato leaf, to the lime, guava, and nectarine on the palate. This wine usually has some green apple, but this vintage doesn’t seem to have any. It’s also lighter in acidity, perhaps L+/M-. It’s all for the good however - this is great stuff."
1838,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.05,"This Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand is very impressive. It's smooth, well balanced and refreshing.

1840,Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 2021,0.0,"Superb, remarkably consistent quality over the years, the 2021 vintage is no exception. It’s for drinking young and enthralls from the very beginning right through to the end - grass, gooseberries, zesty lemon & lime and a drip of honey. Lovely stuff, great value."

1851,Prosecco Treviso Extra Dry N,0.0,"July, '18. Very full of small bubbles. Really quite a nice Prosecco. One of the few I like...  

Prosecco is made using the charmat, or tank, method, so it usually has lower levels of bubbles than, cava or champagne. 

I like this.

Cheers.

Here with his nephew Ricardo Perez in Bierzo. Vineyards farmed organically and biodynamically from the beginning. 50-90yo vines for this entry-level (!), 93% Mencía and many others, including whites. 12m in barriques, 15% new. Unfiltered.

Petalos, the latest triumph from Alvaro Palacios, comes from 60 year-old vines and farmed biodynamically, is an intense wine that mingles beautifully wild plum, smoke and spice flavours."
1922,Pétalos 2019,0.0,"A rich, intense and medium-bodied wine with cherry, plum, red berry, spice and smoke notes on the nose and palate. 

Has a juicy and flavorful finish. 

Pair with lamb, game, pork, charcuterie, and cheeses.  "
1923,Pétalos 2019,0.0,"Total delight.  Whatever it lacks in complexity and structure,  it compensates by a very friendly, elegant and joyful character (acidity and body). Red currant and cherry pit dominate the palate while fresh water/saline  and violets nose make this enological orchestra sound like Vienna Philharmonic."
1924,Pétalos 2019,0.05,"A really lovely entry level Mencia from a great producer. If you like Syrah, you need to try this one. Purple in the glass to a magenta rim. Nose of wet granite, stone, blackberry, black plum, some smoke, wet forest floor, and a touch of dark chocolate. Palate is well balanced with chocolate, blackberry, black plum skin, vanilla bean, with really nice acidity, medium +. Tannin is delicious and soft, medium. Alcohol is integrated, medium (13.5%), medium body. Great value  in a wine with power and finesse."
1925,Pétalos 2019,0.16,"Blackberry, black cherry and a touch of vanilla on the nose. Approachable, wonderfully balanced and a medium length. A touch of plum, oak and black olive on the palate. Great value and a perfect match for Shepherds Pie "
1926,Pétalos 2019,0.12,"3.7+ very aromatic nose of plum, yogurt, and dried herbs. The taste is very interesting with tannin and bold blackberry hitting, yet with a low mid body. Fruit taste is not that abundant with oak present. Still a bit tannic to drink would like it to have a bit more time. 

Second day -> 3.8: tannin reduced and minerality increased. smoother and was not wrong on the bland taste it had. Still very weak in the notes but stronger in herb and tobacco. "
1927,Pétalos 2019,0.0,"I think I may be in love with Bierzo Mencia. This one is no exception. Deep ruby color, medium body, medium intensity. On the nose, pomegranate, minerals, pepper, prune and cherry with pronounced oaky cedar. Lively acidity in perfect harmony with icy tannins. "
1928,Pétalos 2019,0.14,"Very smooth and elegant. Nose - black fruits and hint of oak. Mouth - elegant tannins, well marked but not too strong. Black fruits, oak, maybe red fruit. Low acid level. It is not complex wine but very nice and easy to drink. Good buy below 15 Eur per bottle."
1929,Pétalos 2019,0.0,"Not at all a typical Spanish wine ... of what you normally would expect of ...
Great though!
Reminds of a Northern European Pinot Noir
So cool climate tells the story - but simply great for what it is!"
1930,Pétalos 2019,0.0,"‘19 vintage. Mencia from Bierzo, what a treat. Dark red, lightly tinted on the rims. Initially red cherry, raspberry and a hint of pomegranate, this evolved to a mix of blackberry and sour plum. Lovely lightweight yet structured body, strong tannins, slightly astringent finish. Crushed gravel, graphite and a mineral nature spoke of its biodynamic origins. Some coffee and licorice on the edges of the finish. Slightly oxidative. Still a lovely expression of fruity and earthy tones. Would try again. 4.0"
1931,Pétalos 2019,0.0,"Juicy stuff. Needs a good 10 mins in the glass to open up. Honey, fig and ripe plum. Baking spices coming at yeah right after. Smoke and bramble , strawberries and spices on the palate. Delight full and for just $20 this is pretty delish. 
13.5% from KL Wines in SF. "
1932,Pétalos 2019,0.0,"This youthful, floral-driven red wine displays aromas and flavors of blackberry, pomegranate, and black pepper.

1937,Pétalos 2019,0.06,"The region Bierzo, DO, the grape Mercia. It is a unique grape. I love medium bodied wines and this grape is one of the best. Bright magenta color with guava rim. Red fruits are predominant aromas, cranberry and red cherry and a little white pepper on palate. Since it is 2019, the tannins are a little rough but it is well balanced with acids. "
1938,Pétalos 2019,0.06,"Blind tasted
Nose - blackcurrent, cherry, stewed fruit, plum.

Taste - high tannin, med+ acid, licorice.

I could not make heads or tails of a wine this acidic and tannic, but with such ripe fruit flavours. I guessed a new world nebbiolo.

Menacia, well, the more you know! "
1939,Pétalos 2019,0.0,"Didn’t have time to decant it, I think it’d be better with some time and air since it has pretty firm tannins. Could’ve mistaken it for a Tuscan wine. It has the same tart red cherries, bit of dried herbs, drying tannins and medium body. It does have a bit of meatiness that Sangiovese wines don’t have. Excellent winemaking and amazing value"

1943,Pétalos 2019,0.13,"Really nice wine. Agree with the other comments that the wine needs a few hours to breathe else is very tannic. Nose of plum and black fruit. Mouth of leather and tobacco and oak with black fruits and thyme. Quite some tannins still to give structure (though even with air it is quite a lot.) Recommended, especially for the price "
1944,Pétalos 2019,0.06," Nice young mencia based wine produced by Alvaro Palacios and Ricardo Perez. Deep red cherry colour. Fresh nose of black cherry fruit, liquorice and toasted notes. Elegant and round palate. Soft integrated tannins. Long finish"
1945,Pétalos 2019,0.1,"4.1/5
Now is young to show things. Structurally, it's very solid and age-worthy at least for 5 years+. If aged, it'd be a party of fruit the 3rd flavors harmony. 
Medium purple, high extraction, young, tightly closed. When just opened, it's smoky and fruit-forwarded(sour red cherry, black plum). It's fresh and ripe on nose and palate. A hour later, spices(thyme, pepper), floral, and luxurious neutral cedar, dark chocolate, vanilla, and savory, earthy. 
Paired well with fried pork with Burgundy-style sauce."

1958,Red Blend Aged in Bourbon Barrels 2019,0.19,"Almost fuchsia in color with dark fruit and oak on the nose. A medium-light silky body with very, very little acidity. I liken it to the acidity of a blood orange.  Vanilla, oak, sassafras, wintergreen, molasses, boysenberry, dates, blackberry, blueberry crisp dessert, and brown sugar. The bourbon adds a nice depth to the wine. It is definitely present at first and in the finish. The finish is dry with notes of smoke, cheese, and jam. Definitely unique. I’d  drink again. 4.4 stars"

The nose upon immediately opening was great, dark chocolate, then I poured it, smelt again, yes DC but also something richer, so then I passed it between my partner and I, rich bouquet of fruit cake, raisin, apricot, licorice, orange peel, earth.  
The palate is secondary and tertiary. The fruit is now dried fruits, rich, succulent, with a dry fruity tannic finish. Mouthwatering lingering finish.

2080,Reserva Rioja 2015,0.12,"Fully agree with community here, as this nice  Rioja deserves recognition. Dark ruby in the glass with red fruit, vanilla and tobacco on the nose. Well balanced, gentle, medium bodied wine, with medium acidity and medium tanines. The palate explodes with red cherry at the beginning, then turns into some dark fruit jam eventually ending up with smooth combination of coffee, dark chocolate and some leather aftertaste. Remarkable. "

I've always found LAN to be a reliable producer and while they may not make the smoothest out of the Rioja bunch, I've always appreciated how their wines don't go down without a fight 🥊💥. To be honest I like it a little rough anyway 😳

Did you know: ""LAN"" is actually an acronym using the initials of the three provinces that make up the Rioja DOCa, being Logroño, Álava and Navarra.

2191,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.0,"What a great Rioja! Super tasty and a pleasure to drink. No wonder so many Vivino’ers consistently rate it so well. 2016 edition has recently made it to the shelves; will try that one soon - another excellent vintage: same smooth, earthy taste, reliably good and plenty around to enjoy again."
2192,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.22,What a wonderful Rioja! Super VFM. Very aromatic. Good tannins and flavors. Great aging potential for more years. Opened for about one hour before drinking.  oak cherry vanilla tobacco leather chocolate balsamic mushroom red fruit plum pepper licorice cheese prune dried fruit dried fig violet
2193,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.05,"Dried fig, marzipan, charcuterie, oak and leather on the nose.
Medium+ body, well balanced and integrated acidity and tannins.
A rather fresh and juicy palate, that after a while appears more earthy and meaty. Blueberry, blackberry, blackcurrant and leather, followed by the bitterness from coffee bean, oak, grass, tomato and smoke. Also some subtle mineral notes.
Really good, with decent complexity. Recommended."
2194,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.06,Lovely bold and nicely oaked Rioja this one. Really great balance of tannins and smooth plummy fruit. I decided to decant it on this occasion and it just softens it up a touch. I’d recommend a trip to Majestic while it’s priced below £12. I’ve paid more in the past and it was still worth every penny.
2195,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.0,"This has been for ages a high class Rioja. The 2015 vintage is one of the best. Super smooth, great as stand alone, but not overwhelmed by powerful dishes like heavy jamon pata negra croquettes with mustard. "
2196,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.13,"Very nice and vibrant. Great earthy tones whilst being fruit centric. Strong in leather, oak, pepper, spices, red earth. Over time, deep dark red fruit emerges, ripe prune, cherry too. Good balance, not particularly elegant or structured, but very enjoyable...especially for 10 euros! "
2197,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.0,"The wine must be properly decanted and aerated. The true character will then be evident. This is a very good classic Rioja. I was not able to drink Marques del Riscal until very recently. I got my first hangover after drinking it when I was about 14 and my parents were not looking. Just seeing the label made me remember. Some time ago, I decided to try it and it was great. For this one, 89-90/100. "
2198,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.06,"Wow, velvetty once more with hints of violets and black fruits all over the place. Drank alongside a platter of homemade spaghetti a la ragout. Great combo though the Rioja whispered gently in my ear; next time serve me some red meat... Drink again! Makro"
2199,Rioja Reserva 2015,0.05,"Wow this one is a surprise winner. It is a completely different wine after an hour with air. M+ beautiful nose of black current, plum, baking soda, and licorice, cocoa. Balanced and complex palate, with dark berry fruits, mushroom, herbal tea and even mint candy. Tannin is rough but really jammy too, M fresh acidity kept you wide awake and in awe of the freshness. Lingering M+ finish with plum and butterscotch, with hints of graphite/minerals. Really high quality!"
2200,Rosso di Montalcino 2019,0.0,Last bottle of the night. Just about right - not too heavy and a full on bouquet at the back of the tongue. Great value for money.

2206,Rosso di Montalcino 2019,0.08,"A good Sangiovese based wine. Very smooth and velvety, with a lingering taste of cherries, raspberries and oak. If pleasing, would definitely recommend trying a Brunello di Montalcino."
2207,Rosso di Montalcino 2019,0.08,"Really enjoyable wine, shared with friends over dinner. Has a lot going on, nice cherry hint, along with other red fruit. Leather and tobacco as with an Italian of it type. "

2271,Rosso Veneto 2020,0.0,"Hot day-yum but I love me a delicious libation at bargain prices. It makes it that much tastier and it makes you feel as if you know something nobody else does. *Twirls moustache. I don’t think there’s anything cutting edge happening here; no exotic grapes or enigmatic regions. Just a reliable northern Italian Merlot (which I have reluctantly come to respect). Smooth, bold and full-bodied. This also belongs on the roof where grilled food would go hand-in-hand with the warm, chocolate-y, inviting vibe here.😘"

2274,Rosso Veneto 2020,0.0,Now this was absolutely delicious. It’s very smooth and silky with loads of black cherry flavour with just a little hint of smoke. And shock of shocks it’s Merlot. Not one of my favourite grapes and I probably wouldn’t have bought this if I had seen that fact beforehand. But at least it has helped in opening my mind to Merlot. The second shock with this is that I paid all of $90HK for it. It’s a great value for an amazing wine. I must have more! 😋
2275,Rosso Veneto 2020,0.13,"Velvety smooth and inviting this specimen delivers the musty, earthy, smoky bouquet of a cigar humidor.

Incredibly smooth, not tight at all, and while it has elegant structure and should age almost indefinitely, especially in a large format, the tannins were in no way opposing and did nothing to detract. On the hole, this was just one of the best glasses of wine I have had in a very long time and I was touched by the gesture. We decanted for an hour. Awesome wine! Cheers!🍷"

Same on the palate with almost Rutherford amounts of dust and dryness.
Supple high tannins that will fade over the years. High acid, very long finish.

Aroma - hot wine, thick jam of red berries and stone fruits, cinnamon, clove, plums.
Wine is dry, full body, high but not agressive tannins. Really strong wine (not bc of alc - 15%, but bc of it's deepness), but smooth, with interestingly balanced acidity. I was hoping a lot from this wine and... received even more.
Aftertaste is quite long, with notes of fruits, blooming acidity and whiff of soft bitterness.

Pervasive yet enjoyable tannins (did decant for 1/2 hour).  Serious and powerful flavor profile imbued with racy fresh fruit flavors.  Again, what's with the use of English on the label?  What's wrong with a Spanish name?"
2481,Tarima Hill Old Vines Monastrell 2014,0.11,"(4+) Fantastic wine, this is what monastrell is all about. Big, brash, and craps over so many over oaked (And over priced) US wines.

Nose - Perfumed, very deep, blueberry, black liquorice, touch of creamy oak but well balanced and integrated. Bit hot, but the spicy pepper gives a freshness.

Palate - Full, big old world red fruit, pepper, raspberry compote, liquorice, wood influence is so well judged, complimenting. M acid and m tannin, very good freshness.

Finish - M+, clean, toasty and bit red fruit."

Inspired by Perswijn magazine, who use these glasses as a standard for all their marked tastings both for reds amd whites (let the record state I own no Riedel shares ;-). This bottle was on a 50%  discount so perfect for budget monday as Arjen would say. This Bolgheri has plenty of tannin, leather and cedar structure - with ample cherry and blackberry fruit. Antinori have a whole range of wines from standard to top of the bill. Nice entry level Bolgheri."

WHEN HE WAS A BABY! The Marchese, Piero Antinori almost singlehandedly revived the image of Italian wine. Just try to go 15 rounds with him! Toe to toe, this fun little Super Tuscan punches well above its weight!

A one-two on the nose with black fruit, leather & violets, this boxer stays on its feet, delivering a knockout punch of black cherry, currant & licorice with beautiful sweet spices in a long finish. At $20 this is definitely a people's champion!"

Rich and dark nose is mainly formed by intense cherry tones and backed up with slim peppery notes, subtle licorice and some smokey details.

Med+ body, with silky tannins and lively acidity. Intense cherry based med+ aftertaste.

Aroma of espresso and red berries,  with flavors of dense boysenberry compote, coffee, cloves, and Bolgheri dirt. Tannins are smooth and finish is memorable.  "
2531,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,0.05,This wine really surprised me. It starts with just the right amount of dark fruit. Far from sweet and definitely not a bomb. Next comes the spice. And that is what really made my taste buds happy. Mild yet complex. Lots of character. This is a good wine. And very reasonable priced. I think I got it for $25 at the grocery store. Not the $55 price listed here. This juice is excellent from start to finish.
2532,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,0.12,"Had this a few time and it passes
the test with friends with flying colours. The first time I had it a couple of years ago there was tons of new oak lending a sweet vanilla, maple syrup richness. This though doesn't have that and although young tastes like a more mature classic wine allowing the Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah to come through. Give it time to mature and enjoy this. It's only £12 a bottle."
2533,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,0.17,"4.1 *** always been a fan of Antinori's Il Bruciato. My third vintage and always a pleasant and fulfilling juice at a good price. Was great with Veal Marsala.

Deep purple color with medium ruby rim and very long thin legs.

Nose of black fruit, black tea and cedar.

Opening of black fruit favoring black cherry and black plum with leather, crush red pepper, vanilla, toasted oak and granite.

Medium bodied Ann's light-plus acidity with pleasant, creamy tannins that emerge and fade quickly.

Peace and cheers!"

Named for some of my colleagues as the wine of the night was actually a big surprise since is a young wine and is quite ready.
Tuscan blend 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah (remembering Argentinean Blends), is aged for 12 months in oak and 4 months in bottles,  the nose is dominated by ripe red fruit, sweet spices and coffee. Well balanced and with a cedar touch, the wine shows silky tannins along an spicy finish and good aftertaste."
2539,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,0.15,Love this wine! Bolgheri never seems to disappoint... I know I opened it too soon and It will only get better! Fruit Aromas with Hints of Coffee... Tannins are a little Gritty.... Complex... Leather... Oak... Spice... Long Finish!
2540,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,0.0,"This Supertuscan, made of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah is soft and well balanced. The color is dark ruby. Medium body and soft tannins. Actually this is its disadvantage. It lacks a bite. It's in fact too soft. It has a medium to long finish. And that surprised me.
This French Italian is very nice to drink. I can support this one. "
2541,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,0.1,"A solid classic Super Tuscan blended out of 65% CS, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah, aged in barriques for about 8 months and another 4m in the bottle. 
Warm and intense aromas of stewed berry fruit, black cherries and subtle hints of floral impressions with complementary scents of vanilla espresso, liquorice, sweet pipe tobacco and baking spice. 
A round and generous mouthfeel, showing fine grained tannins, a pleasant freshness with a medium long finish.

2542,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,0.05,"A.A.A big cherry and other riped red fruits parfumes in sinergy with a really pleasant note of wood with a hint of tobacco. Immediate warm, embracing & silky sensations with an optimal correspondence in the mouth. Everything floats in a world of sweet spices, black pepper and tobacco on a surface of silky tannins. Sometimes a handful of rose petals strikes me and I can't do anything but enjoying the final. A dark ruby red with a drop of garnet shades and wonderful tears on the glass complete the picture."
2543,Tenuta Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato Bolgheri 2013,0.0,"Blend of Cab, Merlot, Syrah. There may be some unevenness. The first bottle was strangely earthy,  probably.

2554,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.0,Ridiculously good. Heavy on chocolate and baking spices with tons of complexity that starts on the nose and continues after the finish. Really impressive!

2561,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.06,"The level of complexity in a relatively young wine is testament to the wine makers. This has a nose almost of a grand reserve Rioja. Vanilla, cedar, Christmas pudding, stewed plum etc. Flavours in the mouth were accentuated by the menthol, plum, blackberry, black cherry and cinnamon. I was warned that I would love this wine and it was a reality. "
2562,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.07,"It was like prune boiled to jam. Licorice and vanilla. Spicy: nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. Mouthwatering. 

Casual yet satisfying. 
Knocked me off. It would be a tough call between this and Freakshow CS. "
2563,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.0,"Straight hitting Aussie red. It’s simply put, insanely good value when you pit it against other offerings in the same price point. Important to follow proprietor’s instructions and give this one a bloody good shake, otherwise you’ll find a wine as closed as a fist that’s about to hit you square in the face. "

2567,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.0,"Visually dark and brooding, powerful legs apparent. Heaps of that Langhorne forest floor on the nose, heightens the anticipation. Titanium tannins anchored in a lake of plum, black currant and menthol. Immense, and appreciate the honesty on the label that you shouldn’t keep it far past 2021, so drink it now, 4.3⭐️"
2568,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.0,"Deep ruby with bold aromas of blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, pepper, and redvine licorice.  On the palate flavors of blackberry, blueberry, black pepper, and earthy notes…followed by some heat 16% ABV! "
2569,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.0,"I love this.  I love big wines, though.  Dried dates, fig, plum and baking spices.  I’m taking away a half star because it’s VERY hot even after opening.  Gosh it may have raspberry as well.  Complex.

The palate starts hot again, not going to lie.  Lots of thick prune juice, more thick fig, caramel, strawberry jam, some nutmeg and cinnamon numbness.  It’s big.  I love a big wine.  Oh I said that!  This vineyard is great."
2570,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.06,"Plum, blackberry, oak and some cigar and mocha. Taste has great boldness and lovely silky tannins, with a long finish even for a wine of this youth. Flavor mainly the same as above with a dark chocolate and pepper finish. Great wine and value. Around 4.4, one of the best wines I’ve had at this price."
2571,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.11,"92 pts; deep ruby, lots of dark blackberry and brambly fruit with vanilla and silky tannins. Some RS adds to the richness but there is enough tannin and acidity to prevent it from being flabby. This is big, bold unsubtle red, and very NW in style but I enjoy it a lot. Would be a nice pairing to baby back ribs as it should stand up to the rich glazes often used. Ultra dry reds usually come off as austere in those circumstances. Highly recommended."
2572,The Boxer Shiraz 2019,0.0,"So excited to dive back into the boxer. I lit up when I saw they started carrying it at Trader Joe’s for less than everywhere else I’ve seen it. On the nose: sugary and baking spices, chocolate, and tobacco. On the tongue: warmth, fire, love. "

On the palate, it’s big and beefy with gobs of plum, dark cherries, and Asian spice.  It’s a smidgen hot, but the 16% alcohol is balanced by the round fruit.

Perhaps a hint of dark chocolate at the most but what prevails are the dark fruits: plum, blackberry, cassis. A hint of lead pencil as well.

After decanting it for about 20 minutes it showed notes of earthy, oak, blackberry, leather and tobacco on the nose with chocolate, plum and black currant on the paled.

Full body, high acidity with grippy tannins, I feel like it was too young to be drank but nonetheless it drank beautifully paired with Argentinian empanadas. This would easily be a 4.7 stars in about 3-5 years."

Understand the winery makes ‘tweaks’ each year and for me this one still holds all the core values of chocolate black cherry plum with tobacco and olive hints, it didn’t quite have the long lasting finish of previous years. Perhaps I needed to show more patience! "

2632,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.0,"Blackberry of the early harvest given the acidity, or Schaarbek sour cherries mixed with big red strawberries. Ridiculously easy wine despite having this much going on. Really happy I've got more of this."
2633,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.0,"Ooohh yes. Yes. Yes. This is good stuff. Med, almost deep ruby colour, developing aromas of chocolate, cacao nib, blackberry, black plum, black cherry, black pepper, leather. 
Exceptional integration of the 14.5% alcohol into its full bodied unctuous medley of dark and exciting flavours. So smooth and silky, fine grained medium tannins. 

Drinks very well now. Could see some potential with ageing. "
2634,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.11,"Excellent wine from the well known winery Boekenhoutskloof, Franschhoek region. Mostly Shiraz blended with Grenache, Cinsault, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier. Dark ruby-red colour. Full bodied, very well balanced with fine tannins. Smooth with soft leather, oak and blackberry notes. And then, that dark chocolate taste, vanilla and coffee in the aftertaste with great elegance in the long lingering finish, full of spices that leaves one with an urge to buy a case. "
2635,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.06,"Again and again each vintage of this wine shows signs of greatness. Complex nose showing cherry, blackberry, plum, cocoa, chocolate with some earthy notes and touch of licorice. Juicy blackberry and red fruit on the palate. Rich and mighty structure build on chewy tannins and very well balanced acidity. Smooth, long and evolving finish. "
2636,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.05,Improved a day after opening. Sweet prune and raisins with pepper and long elegant pepper cedar / oak finish. Definitely requires breathing before a delightful opening up. Would be a higher rating (for the price) if cheaper but still good for the ~£20 paid. The last glass has me considering whether 4.5 is high enough velvety smooth but with sufficient character to be interesting.
2637,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.07,"Lots of blackcurrant and plum at first with, as you would expect given the name, plenty of chocolate, vanilla and coffee secondary flavours and a hint of tannin on the finish to bring it all together. "
2638,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.0,"First taste was dark chocolate followed by layers of complexity definitely plum and sour cherry, with a lingering finish. I picked up some liquorice and more intense chocolate when we started our meal. A very good New World red with some definite French influences. Cracking wine
"
2639,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.12,"Stunning South African blend with a floral nose and aromas of stewed fruit, jam and vanilla. Beautifully balanced and rich, smooth and powerful in the mouth. Dark fruits, cherry, jam with a slightly bitter dark chocolate finish. Complex wine that needs to be savoured and explored as it will keep on giving!! 2020 definitely worth buying."
2640,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.1,"Very young, but has Chocolate Block returned to form? Definitely step up on the last few vintages I tried. I saw some of the 20 Syrah destined for this wine coming into the cellar

Various oak regimes, but nearly all old for 11-14 months

2643,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.16,"Top stuff. Strange aroma - can’t - quite earthy. Bold, smooth, soft. Goes down too easily. Dark fruit flavours -
plum. Notes of oak and chocolate. A great go to wine for a nice evening. "
2644,The Chocolate Block 2020,0.13,"Very Dark Chocolate 🍫 in colour. Rich aromas of Black Cherry 🍒 and Plum stand out complimented by Subtle Oak. On the palate first to stand out is Mild White Pepper 🫑 followed Black Currant and Plum. These flavours are expanded by a Hint of Cloves, Subtle Cigar and Earthy notes.

2739,The Prisoner Saldo Zinfandel,0.0,"What a complex and fun wine. The sweetness really shines through.  I finished a bottle myself and by the 3rd glass the sweetness was a bit overpowering, but a single glass makes for a dynamite pairing.  5/5 for price range.  "
2740,The Prisoner Saldo Zinfandel,0.19,"This non-vintage bottle was on the sale at Mövenpick so I indulged me one. Amazing nose of red fruit, chocolate, clove, oak and a jammylicious palate of black cherry, cream, mocha and vanilla. 15.5% of the fun stuff. A perfect pairing for picanha bbq, a true meat lover. I’m stopping at 4.2⭐️ because the sweetness intensity was much too much for my taste buds, but it’s for sure a helluva juice, on pair with the greatness of some remarkable Primitivos and Amarones 🤙🏻"
2741,The Prisoner Saldo Zinfandel,0.05,"Lets say that you have a group of guests that have a California preferenced palate. Buy Saldo. Period. The black & red fruit have hints of smoke & cedar on nose. The palate is more transparent w/ jammy blackcurrant, blackberry, strawberry, cherry that dominate subtle chocolate & earthy tones. What’s most enjoyable about this wine is the softness. Critics may say too much malolactic fermentation but it brings you to an enjoyable edge. Rich, velvety, a touch off-dry. A winner in all 50 states no doubt 4.5/5"

2833,Three Valleys 2019,0.0,"Not quite enough Zinfandel to be labeled by the varietal, you can look at the label and get a sense for what this Italian style field blend is packing. This producer really does have a unique approach to Wine Making and my appreciation for what they do grows every time I have another taste of their wines. I got to tour the Lytton Springs property last summer and it was terrific. This is a youthful wine that could stand more age if you’re patient, but it’s drinks well enough now if you can’t wait.

Serve it at 6-7C for the “best presentation.” Green apples, peach, orange rind, green gooseberry, yeast & bread dough, minerals— simple and predictable but all “in a good way.” Makes a delicious pairing with roasted pork served with boiled potatoes and steamed asparagus. Overall, a rather typical food champagne with little (if any) memory left."
